# LangChain-Tools-and-Tool-Calling

This repository offers a practical guide to understanding and using **Tools** and **Tool Calling** features in LangChain. It includes Jupyter notebooks and notes designed to help developers effectively build interactive language model applications using external tools and APIs.

## ðŸ§  Overview

LangChain enables LLMs to interact with external tools through a well-structured interface. This capability allows models to go beyond pure text generation and access functionalities like search engines, calculators, and custom APIs.

In this project, you'll explore:

1. **What are Tools in LangChain?**
   - How tools extend the capability of LLMs.
   - Building and registering custom tools.

2. **Tool Calling with LangChain**
   - Automatically selecting the appropriate tool based on user intent.
   - Integrating with OpenAI's `tool_calling` features.

3. **Hands-on Notebooks**
   - `tools_in_langchain.ipynb`: Covers how to define and use tools.
   - `tool_calling_in_langchain.ipynb`: Demonstrates tool invocation from language model outputs.
